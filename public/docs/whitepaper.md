## 1. Abstract

MAYA is a seven-protocol solidarity stack built on Solana. It combines AI-verified escrow, production bonds, reputation-as-a-service, proof-of-skill credentials, an AI agent marketplace, guild enterprise contracts, and cross-border payment corridors — all powered by a single deflationary token.

**What makes MAYA different from every other crypto project:**

- Real revenue from real marketplace activity (not speculation)
- Holder revenue share paid in USDC (not inflationary token rewards)
- Reputation that travels across all of Web3 (not locked in one platform)
- AI agents that earn for you 24/7 (not just human labor)
- Guild contracts for enterprise-scale projects (not just freelancer gigs)
- Permanent burns from every trade (not "maybe we'll burn someday")

**We don't give away tokens. We don't pay for engagement. Your reputation — earned through real work — is worth more than any airdrop ever could be.**

## 2. The Sourdough Thesis

### How Fermentation Built Civilization

| Era | Innovation | Impact |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| 10,000 BC | Grain fermentation | Invented bread & beer, enabled settlement |
| 3,000 BC | Grain as currency | First money systems, trade networks |
| 1,400 AD | Banking system | Centralized trust, enabled commerce |
| 2009 | Bitcoin | Decentralized trust, eliminated middlemen |
| 2026 | **MAYA** | **Decentralized reputation, eliminated platforms** |

Sourdough starter is the oldest continuously living organism cultivated by humans. It doesn't just ferment — **it transforms everything it touches.** Flour becomes bread. Grain becomes beer. Communities become civilizations.

### MAYA as Digital Starter Culture

- **It's alive**: The ecosystem grows with every trade, every bond, every contribution
- **It's self-sustaining**: No central authority feeds it — the community feeds itself
- **It transforms**: Strangers become collaborators, skills become capital, reputation becomes value
- **It cannot be killed**: Like sourdough shared across generations, the culture persists
- **It goes into ANY dough**: MAYA reputation plugs into any Web3 project via API

## 3. Problem Statement

### The Extraction Economy

| Platform | Fee | Reputation Portability | Worker Ownership |
|----------|-----|----------------------|-----------------|
| Fiverr | 20% | ❌ Locked | 0% |
| Upwork | 10-20% | ❌ Locked | 0% |
| TaskRabbit | 15% | ❌ Locked | 0% |
| **MAYA** | **1-3%** | **✅ Portable (RaaS)** | **✅ Revenue Share** |

### The Memecoin Problem

Most "utility" tokens:
- Give away tokens → dilutes believers
- Promise staking APY → funded by inflation (Ponzi)
- Have no revenue → price = pure speculation
- Centralized → "decentralized" in name only

### MAYA's Thesis

**What if a token's value came from real economic activity? And what if loyalty was rewarded with real revenue — not more tokens?**

### The Flywheel

```
Trades → Fees → Burns + Revenue Share + Commons
  ↑                                        │
  └── More Users ← Better Reputation ←─────┘
```

Each trade simultaneously:
1. Generates protocol revenue
2. Burns tokens (increasing scarcity)
3. Pays holders real USDC
4. Funds the community treasury
5. Builds reputation for both participants
6. Creates skill credentials

## 5. Layer 1: AI-Verified Escrow

### How It Works

```
Step 1: DEFINE CONTRACT
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📋 Deliverables:                        │
│  ☐ 3 logo concepts (PNG, 1000x1000+)    │
│  ☐ Final version in PNG + SVG + AI       │
│  📝 Revisions: 2 major, 3 minor          │
│  ⏰ Deadline: 7 days                     │
│  💰 Payment: 200 USDC                    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘

Step 2: BOTH SIGN (crypto wallets)
  ✍️ Buyer signed  → immutable on-chain
  ✍️ Seller signed → cannot be disputed

Step 3: ESCROW HOLDS PAYMENT
  200 USDC → escrow smart contract

Step 4: SELLER DELIVERS
  AI Agent checks:
  ├── ✅ 3 files uploaded? → Yes
  ├── ✅ PNG format, 1000x1000+? → Yes
  ├── ✅ SVG included? → Yes
  ├── ✅ Deadline met? → Yes (Day 5)
  ├── ✅ Revisions within limit? → 2/2 used
  └── ALL PASSED → ESCROW RELEASED ✅

Step 5: RARE CASE — DISPUTE
  └── Arbiter fee: 50 USDC (loser pays)
```

The AI doesn't judge quality — it verifies **measurable, objective criteria**. This eliminates 90% of disputes.

### Fee Structure

| Trade Volume (30d) | Fee Rate |
|-------------------|----------|
| < $1,000 | 3% |
| $1,000 – $10,000 | 2% |
| > $10,000 | 1% |

Higher reputation scores and holder tiers unlock lower fees faster.

---

## 6. Layer 1: Production Bonds

### How It Works

```
EXAMPLE: Baker needs equipment ($1,000)

┌─ Baker creates bond ─────────────────────────┐
│  Product: 40 Sourdough Starter Kits          │
│  Retail value: 40 × $35 = $1,400            │
│  Bond price: $1,000 (28% discount)           │
│  Delivery: 6 months, staged                  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ Investors buy ──────────────────────────────┐
│  10 people × $100 = $1,000 → ESCROW          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ Staged delivery ────────────────────────────┐
│  Month 2: 10 kits → $250 released ✅         │
│  Month 3: 10 kits → $250 released ✅         │
│  Month 4: 10 kits → $250 released ✅         │
│  Month 6: 10 kits → $250 released ✅         │
│  Bond COMPLETE ✅                             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

RESULT:
  Baker: Got $1,000 capital + keeps equipment
  Investors: Got $1,400 product for $1,000
  Platform: Earned ~$10-30 in fees
  Everyone's reputation: INCREASED
```

### Where Does the "Extra" Value Come From?

**Nobody "pays" the difference. The baker PRODUCES it.**

Like a farmer: seeds cost $10, labor costs $20, harvest is worth $200. The $170 "extra" comes from production + labor, not from another person's pocket. Bond investors get a discount for early capital. Both sides win through production.

### Risk Protection

- **Staged releases**: Money unlocks only as delivery progresses
- **Reputation limits**: First bond max $200, grows with trust
- **Auto-refund**: Undelivered portion returns to investors
- **Reputation penalty**: Defaults permanently recorded on-chain

### Secondary Market

Bonds are transferable SPL tokens. Buyer no longer needs the product? Sell your bond to someone who does. Market price reflects the worker's reputation. **First liquid market for future labor in crypto.**

---

## 7. Layer 2: Reputation Protocol (RaaS)

### The Big Idea

MAYA Reputation isn't just for MAYA. **It's an open protocol any Web3 project can use.**

```
MAYA provides trust data, like Chainlink provides price data.

Today:
├── NFT marketplace → shows seller's MAYA trust score
├── DAO → checks MAYA reputation before member admission
├── DeFi protocol → offers better rates to high-reputation users
├── Gaming guild → requires MAYA score for entry
└── Any new project → "Connect MAYA Reputation" button

API call: maya.reputation(wallet_address) → score, tier, history
Fee per query: paid in MAYA tokens → permanent demand
```

### Why This Is Massive

- **Total addressable market = all of Web3** (not just MAYA marketplace)
- **MAYA token = gas for reputation queries** → external demand
- **Network effect**: more projects integrate → more valuable the score → more projects integrate
- **"Web3's credit score"** — a trillion-dollar concept

### Soulbound Dynamic NFT

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│        🏅 MAYA SOUL BADGE            │
│           @baker_ali                 │
│                                      │
│  Tier: ████████░░ Master Baker      │
│  Score: 82/100                       │
│  Guild: 🍞 Craft + 💻 Dev           │
│  Trades: 34 completed               │
│  Bonds: 3 fulfilled / 0 defaulted   │
│  Skills: ✅ Design ✅ Translation    │
│  AI Agents: 2 active (reputation 78)│
│  Member since: March 2026            │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Cannot be sold (soulbound)
- Dynamically updates visuals as tier grows
- Portable across all of Web3
- More valuable than tokens — it unlocks real economic benefits

---

## 8. Layer 2: Proof-of-Skill Protocol

### The Problem with Credentials

| Traditional | MAYA Proof-of-Skill |
|------------|-------------------|
| University degree ($100K, 4 years) | On-chain credential (free, earned by working) |
| LinkedIn endorsement (anyone clicks a button) | Verified by completed escrow trades |
| Portfolio (can be faked) | Immutable on-chain record |
| Certification (pay, pass test, forget) | Living credential that grows with each job |

### How It Works

```
Every completed escrow trade → auto-generates a skill credential

Example: Ali completes 10 logo design trades
├── Trade 1: Logo for bakery ✅ (4.8/5 satisfaction)
├── Trade 2: Logo for startup ✅ (5/5)
├── ... 
├── Trade 10: Logo for NGO ✅ (4.9/5)
└── 🎓 CREDENTIAL EARNED: "Verified Logo Designer"

Credential tiers:
├── 🟢 Beginner: 5 completed trades in category
├── 🔵 Skilled: 25 completed trades
├── 🟣 Expert: 100 completed trades  
├── 🟡 Master: 500 completed trades
└── Each tier has on-chain badge + visual NFT update

These credentials:
├── Show up on your Reputation NFT
├── Queryable via API (employers, clients, platforms)
├── Cannot be faked (backed by real completed work)
├── Don't expire (but decay if inactive)
└── Replace CVs, portfolios, and degrees
```

### The Sourdough Metaphor

*"You learn baking from dough, not textbooks. Skills are proven by work, not diplomas."*

---

## 9. Layer 2: AI Agent Marketplace

### The Concept

```
Traditional marketplace:
  Human → does work → gets paid → builds reputation

MAYA AI marketplace:
  Human creates AI Agent → Agent does work 24/7 → 
  Human gets paid → Agent builds reputation

Your agent:
├── Takes orders from the marketplace
├── Delivers according to AI-verified contract terms
├── Builds its own reputation score
├── Earns you passive income
└── Can be "fired" (deregistered) if it performs poorly
```

### How It Works

1. **Build** an AI agent (logo generator, translator, code reviewer, content writer)
2. **Register** it on MAYA marketplace with available services + pricing
3. **Clients** find your agent, create escrow contract, submit request
4. **Agent delivers** — same AI verification checks as human trades
5. **Escrow releases** — you receive payment minus platform fee
6. **Agent reputation** updates — good work = higher score = more clients

### Why This Matters

- **AI agent economy is 2026's biggest narrative** — MAYA is positioned perfectly
- **Nobody else combines AI agents + reputation + escrow** — first mover advantage
- **Passive income**: your agent works while you sleep, across all time zones
- **Quality control**: bad agents lose reputation, get fewer orders, earn nothing
- **Volume multiplier**: agents work 24/7 = dramatically higher marketplace volume = more burns

### The Sourdough Metaphor

*"Sourdough multiplies on its own. AI agents earn on their own."*

---

## 10. Layer 3: Guild Enterprise Protocol

### The Problem

A solo freelancer can't bid on a $50,000 corporate rebrand. They lack the team, the portfolio depth, and the trust signal. **Guilds solve this.**

### How It Works

```
Example: Design Guild takes on enterprise project

┌─ Guild Formation ────────────────────────────┐
│  10 designers with complementary skills      │
│  Guild reputation = weighted avg of members  │
│  Collective bond capacity: $50,000           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ Enterprise Contract ────────────────────────┐
│  Client: TechCorp needs complete rebrand     │
│  Budget: $50,000 in escrow                   │
│  Roles:                                       │
│  ├── Lead Designer: 25% ($12,500)            │
│  ├── 3 Senior: 15% each ($7,500)            │
│  ├── 4 Junior: 7.5% each ($3,750)           │
│  └── Guild Lead: 5% ($2,500)                │
│  Smart contract auto-distributes on delivery │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ Delivery ───────────────────────────────────┐
│  Milestone 1: Brand strategy    → $10K ✅    │
│  Milestone 2: Visual identity   → $15K ✅    │
│  Milestone 3: Digital assets    → $15K ✅    │
│  Milestone 4: Brand guidelines  → $10K ✅    │
│  → Auto-distributed to all members           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Benefits

- **For freelancers**: Access to enterprise-scale projects impossible alone
- **For clients**: Decentralized team at fair rates (no agency 3x markup)
- **For MAYA**: Enterprise contracts = massive volume = massive burns
- **For guilds**: Collective reputation grows → attracts bigger clients

### The Sourdough Metaphor

*"One culture makes one loaf. Ten cultures run a bakery."*

---

## 11. Layer 3: Cross-Border Solidarity

### The Problem

A Turkish designer gets hired by a US client:
- Bank wire: 3-5 business days, $25-45 fee
- PayPal: 4.5% conversion + 2.9% fee = ~7.4%
- Upwork: 10% platform fee on top of everything

**Total cost: 15-20% of the payment**

### MAYA Solution

```
Same transaction through MAYA:

Client (US) → 200 USDC → MAYA Escrow (Solana)
├── Cost: 2% platform fee ($4)
├── Settlement: ~2 seconds
├── Conversion: designer swaps USDC → TRY via DEX
├── Total cost: ~2.5% (including DEX swap)
└── Savings vs traditional: 80%+

Client pays: $200
Designer receives: ~$195
Traditional: designer would receive ~$160-170
```

### Why This Is Huge

- **Global remittance market: $700 billion/year**
- **Cross-border freelance: $200 billion/year**
- **Real economic impact** — developing country talent gets full value
- **Reputation crosses borders** — your skills speak every language

### The Sourdough Metaphor

*"The Silk Road carried grain. MAYA Network carries value."*

---

## 12. Community Launchpad

### How It Works

```
Step 1: PROPOSE
  A member submits a project idea with budget
  Example: "Build a MAYA mobile app — $15,000"

Step 2: DISCUSS (1 week)
  Community reviews feasibility, team, budget

Step 3: VOTE (Quadratic)
  Voting Power = √(tokens committed)
  Prevents whale dominance

Step 4: FUND
  Approved → Commons Treasury releases funds

Step 5: BUILD  
  Guild members staff the project team

Step 6: RETURN
  15% of project revenue → back to Commons Treasury
  The fund replenishes itself
```

**No VCs. No gatekeepers. The community funds its own ecosystem.**

---

## 13. Holder Benefits & Loyalty Tiers

### Why Hold MAYA?

Most crypto projects: "Buy our token and... hope the price goes up."

MAYA: "Buy our token and earn real USDC revenue, lower fees, and exclusive access that grows as the marketplace grows."

### Revenue Share

**15% of ALL protocol revenue is distributed to qualifying holders in USDC.**

Not in MAYA tokens (that would be inflation). In actual USDC stablecoins. Every month. Based on your tier.

### Tier System

| Tier | Requirement | Escrow Fee | Bond Limit | Revenue Share |
|------|------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| 🫓 Fresh Dough | Hold any amount | 3% | — | — |
| 🍞 Rising Baker | 30 days + $100 held | 2.5% | $500 | Eligible |
| 👨‍🍳 Master Baker | 90 days + $500 held | 2% | $2,000 | Priority |
| 👑 Genesis Baker | Held since launch | 1.5% | $5,000+ | Maximum |

### Genesis Baker — The Unrepeatable Badge

If you've been holding since the Pump.fun launch and NEVER sold:
- **Exclusive Genesis Badge** — never issued again, permanently on your NFT
- **Priority funding** from Commons Treasury
- **Governance veto** on critical protocol decisions
- **1.5% escrow fee** — the lowest tier
- **$5,000+ bond limits** — maximum trust
- **Maximum revenue share weight** — largest portion of the USDC pool

**Sell even once → tier resets to Fresh Dough. Hold time restarts from zero. Genesis Badge? Gone. Forever.**

### Deflationary Math (Why Holding Gets Better)

```
Your holding: 1,000,000 MAYA (0.10% of supply)

Launch:  Supply 1,000,000,000 → Your share: 0.100%
Year 1:  Supply   997,600,000 → Your share: 0.1002%
Year 3:  Supply   760,000,000 → Your share: 0.1316%
Year 5:  Supply   600,000,000 → Your share: 0.1667%

Your ownership grew 67% — by doing absolutely nothing.
No staking required. No locking. Just holding.
```

Plus you're earning USDC revenue share on top of this.

## 14. Revenue Model & Burn Mechanics

### Revenue Distribution

```
Protocol Revenue (1-3% of GMV)
         │
         ├── 50% → Operations
         │         ├── Development
         │         ├── Infrastructure
         │         └── Growth
         │
         ├── 15% → Holder Revenue Share
         │         ├── Paid in USDC
         │         ├── Monthly distribution
         │         └── Tier-weighted
         │
         ├── 15% → Commons Treasury
         │         ├── Community loans (RBF)
         │         ├── Launchpad funding
         │         └── Emergency fund
         │
         └── 20% → Buyback & Burn
                   ├── Market buy MAYA tokens
                   └── Send to burn address (permanent)
```

### Burn Projections

| Monthly GMV | Fee Rate | Monthly Revenue | Holder Share | Monthly Burn |
|-------------|----------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| $100K | 2.5% | $2,500 | $375 | $500 |
| $1M | 2.0% | $20,000 | $3,000 | $4,000 |
| $10M | 1.5% | $150,000 | $22,500 | $30,000 |
| $100M | 1.2% | $1,200,000 | $180,000 | $240,000 |

### Fixed Supply, Only Burns

MAYA has a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens with **no minting capability**. Every burn permanently reduces circulating supply. There is no inflation mechanism. No staking rewards. No airdrops. No team unlocks.

---

## 15. Commons Treasury & Governance

### Funding

15% of all protocol revenue flows to Commons automatically. No vote needed to fund it — only to spend it.

### Quadratic Voting

```
Voting Power = √(tokens_committed)

1 token   → 1.00 votes
4 tokens  → 2.00 votes  
9 tokens  → 3.00 votes
10,000    → 100 votes (not 10,000)
```

A whale with 10,000 tokens gets 100 votes, not 10,000. Democracy, not plutocracy.

### Revenue-Based Financing

Micro-loans from Commons, repaid as % of marketplace earnings:
- No interest — repay a fixed cap (1.3-1.5x principal)
- Revenue-linked — repay 10% of marketplace earnings
- Natural cap — max 24 months
- Only for wallets with completed trades (reputation-gated)

### Sybil Resistance

- Only wallets with completed trades can vote
- Minimum token lock per vote
- Time-weighted voting (longer holding = more effective)

---

## 16. Security Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- AI verification layer for all escrow contracts
- Each trade has isolated escrow — no shared pool risk
- Circuit breakers: emergency pause (multisig)
- Bug bounty program

### Treasury
- Squads Protocol 3-of-5 multisig
- 48-hour time lock on transactions > $10,000
- All movements visible on-chain
- Progressive decentralization → full DAO

### User Safety
- Non-custodial — users control their wallets
- Soulbound NFTs — can't be stolen and used
- Rate limiting — anti-spam, anti-manipulation
- Open source — publicly auditable

## Appendix B: Reputation Score Formula

```
ReputationScore = Σ(trade_value × completion × time_decay × bond_bonus)

trade_value     = min(log10(usd + 1) / 4, 1.0)
completion      = { success: 1.0, partial: %, failed: 0, won_dispute: 0.8, lost: -0.5 }
time_decay      = e^(-days / 365)
bond_bonus      = { fulfilled: 1.5, partial: 0.8, defaulted: 0.3, none: 1.0 }

Tiers:
  Fresh Dough:    0-19
  Rising:         20-39
  Proofing:       40-59
  Fermented:      60-79
  Master Baker:   80-94
  Aged Starter:   95-100

Decay: -0.5 points/month after 90 days inactive
Floor: 0 (cannot go negative)
```

## Appendix C: Burn Schedule Projections

### Conservative

```
Year 1:   $2M GMV    →  $50K revenue    →  $10K burned
Year 2:  $10M GMV    → $200K revenue    →  $40K burned
Year 3:  $50M GMV    → $750K revenue    → $150K burned
Year 5: $200M GMV    → $2.4M revenue    → $480K burned
```

### Optimistic (with AI agents + guilds)

```
Year 1:  $10M GMV    →  $200K revenue   →   $40K burned
Year 2: $100M GMV    → $1.5M revenue    →  $300K burned
Year 3: $500M GMV    →  $6M revenue     → $1.2M burned
Year 5:   $2B GMV    → $24M revenue     → $4.8M burned
```

AI agents multiplying marketplace volume makes the optimistic scenario achievable. Agents trade 24/7 across all time zones — human-only marketplaces can't match this throughput.
